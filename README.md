# TableCrawler

TableCrawler is a Lego Mindstorms EV3 program.
It allows your robot to autonomously navigate on your kitchen or dining table.
It will avoid obstacles based on ultra sound. It will avoid falling off the table with a light intensity sensor.
This is only a program, you will still need to build a robot or tank for it to be used with the EV3 brick.
